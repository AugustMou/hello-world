# hello-world

Hi,Humans!

Hello everyone, as a newcomer to the Java industry, I salute you all! Because I like the Java industry, I chose to major in software 
technology when I was in college. I am familiar with the Java foundation, familiar with the framework of the Web, such as Springmvc, 
Mybatis, Hibernate. Understand the Java modular architecture design.
